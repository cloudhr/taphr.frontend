### Policies

Company wide policies and process definitions. This is where you create and add them to departments and/or employees.
They are basically a set of rules applied to specific fields of objects. e.g documents, employees, plan, goals
This way the functioning of the system is influenced by policies that have been created by an admin. Of course these mentioned
objects can also have free will i.e no policies in place that define thier properties at a particular point in time
